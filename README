Home to the Kappa Android Kernel Based on official sources by Sony (4.1.B.1.13) Modded with Governors taken from @DoomLord SIO Scheduler by Miguel Boton Currently only available to semc_mango_defconfig For selection of Governors or IO scheduler make menuconfig to be used. This kernel is a work in progress, it's not usable yet. I hereby decline any responsability if you compile it, flash and then find yourself with an expensive paperweight!
